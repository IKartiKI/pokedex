# Pokedex

This is Pokedex — a basic React Native (Expo) app that displays Pokémon names and types with simple file-based routing and other basic features.

## Quick start

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npx expo start
```

Edit the UI in `app/index.tsx`. Routes live in the `app/` folder.
